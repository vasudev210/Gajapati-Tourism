        <h1>Culture & Heritage</h1><br>
        <h2>Art and Culture of Gajapati District</h2><br>
        <p>Welcome to Gajapati Tourism, your gateway to exploring the natural beauty and rich cultural heritage of
            Gajapati district in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Tribals form majority of the population of Gajapati
            District.
            The Saora Community constitutes the largest group among them and Lanjia Saora is considered most primitive
            in this district.
            The Saouras are one of the oldest known tribes of India. They are called by various terms such as Savaras,
            Sabaras,
            Saura, Sora etc. But here the term Saora is used uniformly as it is closely approximatestheir language.
            They are widely distributed from Bundelkhand in the west to Odisha in the east. But they are found in great
            compactness on the edges of the Eastern ghats in Ganjam, Gajapati and Koraput District of Odisha and
            Srikakulam district
            of Andhra Pradesh. The Saoras show their racial affinity to the Proto Australoid physical characters which
            are dominant
            among the aborigines of Central and Southern India. Their language is akin to the Kolarian stock which has
            close resemblance
            to the forms of speech of the wild tribes of Malayan Peninsula and Nicobar Islands. Their linguistic
            affinity with the
            tribes of South-East suggests their migration from the Islands of India Archipelago and Malayan peninsula,
            unless contrary
            is proved that India was the cradle-land of the Kolan speaking tribes and the South-Eastern countries were
            colonized
            by them. The term Saora appears to have two connotations – one derived from Sagoriss, the Scythian word for
            axe and the
            other from Saba roye’, the Sanskrit term for carrying a dead boy. Both of them fit well with their habit of
            carrying
            an axe always on their shoulders with their primitive occupation of hunting. The epics and purans refer to
            their devotion
            to the Hindu religious heroes like Rama and the Jagannath cult. The legend of Viswabasu, a Saora king who
            worshipped the
            image of Vishnu in the term of Lord Jagannath indicates the impact of Vaishnavism on the Saoras. It is well
            known that,
            like other tribal communities, the Saoras are the indigenous, autochthons of India in the sense that they
            had been long
            settled in different parts of the country particularly on the plains and river valleys and other fertile
            areas. Many of
            the Saoras were in a food gathering economy and a few were perhaps on the threshold of a real food producing
            economy.
            On the whole, they were in all respects primitive, wild and under developed.</p><br><br>

        <p>Economic Organisation: The Saoras can be divided broadly into 2 economic classes – (1) The Saoras of the
            plains depending on
            their wet cultivation or wage earning and selling fire wood and (2) The Hill Saoras practicing shifting and
            terraced cultivation on
            the hill slopes. In most cases the Saoras of the plains are subservient to the advanced section of the
            neighbouring non-tribal communities.
            They provide labour to the non-tribal land owners at the time of weeding, transplanting, harvesting and
            other agricultural operations and
            sell firewood and leaf plates in the local markets. In all these works women rather than men take active
            part and earn the major part of
            the family income. Village: Saora village broadly confirm to a linear pattern. Each village consists of two
            rows of houses facing each
            other and separated by a long and narrow village street. The individual houses in each row are built
            adjacent to one another thus forming
            the front veranda of the entire houses- continuous one from one end of the row to the other. Among the hill
            Saoras, the villages
            are situated In the most in-accessible areas that can be imagined and in most cases lie hidden in thick
            forests making it most
            difficult to reach them except through zigzag foot paths. Their settlements are not shifting. There is
            nothing of nomadic nature in
            their settlement pattern. The size of the Saora village is mainly Governed by the extent of hill slopes and
            forest land available
            for shifting cultivation. Hunting: Archery continuous to be important for hunting, fishing and
            self-protection. The bow-string, like
            in bow of string instruments is made from tenders of salapa vine. Most of fishing of Saora is still done
            with bow and arrow. This in turn
            depending on keen eyesight and sharp reflexes.</p>
